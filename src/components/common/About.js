          <hr />
          <p>Everything we do makes booking recording studios simple â€“ from our dedication to the highest quality recording studios in the world, to the way we establish meaningful connections with our clients and partners.</p>
          <p>We began as a single London studio in 1984, and since then we have sought to make the complexes we own, and each studio that we partner with, a cut above the rest.</p>
          <p>Today AirStudio has the greatest directory of quality recording studios, with more than 170 throughout the world. We only work with studios we feel will deliver to the standard that our customers have come to expect.</p>
          <p>Although running recording studios is our core business, we have now grown into a 360-degree company offering many other services, all aligned to our core studio business: AirStudio which includes recording studios, mastering studios, long-term lets and engineers; AirStudio Builds which comprises studio builds, design and installs; AirStudio Gear which incorporates brand new and secondhand audio gear sales, brokerage and financing;  Drum sample library expert Drumdrops; and artist and producer management company Pieces of 8 Music.</p>
          <p>If you are looking for a recording studio in London or anywhere in the world, start searching our comprehensive site now. If you need any help or cannot find the studio you need then give our bookings team a ring on +44 (0) 207 232 0008.</p>
